## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18+ recommended)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- MongoDB (for local setup) or use Docker to manage MongoDB as a service


## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git

 cd your-repo

```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
    npm install
```
3. Set up environment variables:
Copy the .env.example to .env and fill in the necessary values. Refer to the Environment Variables section for details.


## Environment variables 
Below are the required environment variables for the project. Add these to your .env file:
```bash 
PORT=7000
APP_SECRET=yourSecretKey
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://admin:admin@db:27017/monolithic_ts?authSource=admin
NODE_ENV = dev
```
or simply run in your terminal. :
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Docker Usage
Building and Running the Application with Docker

1. Build and start the Docker containers:
```bash 
    docker-compose up --build
```
This command builds the Docker image (if it hasnâ€™t been built) and starts both the application and MongoDB containers.

2. Shutting down the containers: 
```bash
docker-compose down

```
This stops and removes the containers but preserves the volume data.

## Accessing the MongoDB Database
The MongoDB service is exposed on port 27017. If you want to inspect or manage the database locally, you can connect using a MongoDB client like MongoDB Compass with the connection URI provided in .env.

## Docker Volumes
The MongoDB data is persisted in a Docker volume named mongodb_data, defined in the docker-compose.yaml file. This allows the database data to persist even if the containers are stopped or removed.
## API Documentation

This projectâ€™s API is documented using Swagger to provide detailed and interactive API documentation for developers. You can use this documentation to understand the available endpoints, request methods, authentication, and response formats.


## Swagger UI Access
To access the Swagger UI:

1. Local Environment:
-  Open your browser and go to http://localhost:7000/api-docs (replace with the correct port if different).
2. Using Docker:
- If you are running the project in Docker, ensure that the api-docs path is exposed properly, and navigate to the same URL.

## Authentication with bearerAuth
Note: Some routes require JWT-based authentication. To access these secured endpoints:
- Use the Authorize button in the Swagger UI and provide a valid JWT token.
- The JWT should be prefixed with Bearer (e.g., Bearer <your_token>).

### Some available endpoints:

| Endpoints | Method     | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `/product/create` | POST | Creates a new product |
| `/category/{type}` | GET     | Retrieves product by category                |
| `/product/{id}` | GET | Retrieves product by ID |
| `/wishlist` | PUT | Adds a product to the wishlist (Auth required) |
| `cart` | PUT     | Add a product to cart (Auth required)                |
| `/cart/{id}` | DELETE | Removes a product from the cart (Auth required) |


## Example Request Using `curl`
For those who want to test the API directly from the command line:

```bash 
curl -i -X POST "http://localhost:{PORT}/customer/login" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email": "example@gmail.com", "password": "your_password"}'

```
### Expected output if using `-i` flag in the curl

```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Powered-By: Express
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Set-Cookie: authToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJlbWFpbCI6Imtpc2hhbkBnbWFpbC5jb20iLCJfaWQiOiI2NzM0YjQwOGVmNGNkZjkzZWNiMWI5OTkiLCJpYXQiOjE3MzE1MTAyNDUsImV4cCI6MTczNDEwMjI0NX0.1OOqkeS_hgmBlPffRjZ_DSSsn6M5TMh68mHzSiLLelU; Path=/; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 227
ETag: W/"e3-gctCJe90Ul97Dmkg2L1EIlwc/vg"
Date: Wed, 13 Nov 2024 15:04:05 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
Keep-Alive: timeout=5
```
This will include both the response body and the response headers. Look for a Set-Cookie header in the response, which should look something like:

```bash
Set-Cookie: token=<JWT_TOKEN>; Path=/; HttpOnly; Max-Age=3600; SameSite=Strict;

```

If the cookie is set, it will appear in the Set-Cookie header, and the browser (or curl in this case) will store it for subsequent requests.
